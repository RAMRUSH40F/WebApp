Here Ive been learning servlets for a while. Now I am making a site with a shopping list and an authorisation by myself only.
Next steps :

1.Adding to a cart as /cart?name=string&price=int
2.Create few objects of shopping products, which would be added to a cart. Each of them has a name, a price, country of origin.
3.Create a Cart object which is  Map with key=name, value = int quantity
4. Cart -> Cookie


... Post a value with a space and a button
... SQL Table of products with unique ids, name, price, origin.
